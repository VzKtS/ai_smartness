# AI Smartness Project Structure:
#   src/ai_smartness/  → SOURCES (MUST be tracked in git)
#   /ai_smartness/     → LOCAL DEPLOY (ignored, created by install.sh)
#
# ⚠️  AGENTS: DO NOT add "ai_smartness/" without leading slash!
#     - "/ai_smartness/" ignores only root folder (correct)
#     - "ai_smartness/" ignores ALL folders with this name including src/ (WRONG)

# Local deployed version only (leading slash = root of repo only)
/ai_smartness/
